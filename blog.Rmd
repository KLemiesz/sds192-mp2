## Loading the data
```{r}
library(dplyr)
data <- left_join(committees, contributions)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
```




Possibly in contributions: group by committee, summarise the average contribution, left join with committees
